/* The time has a format: hours:minutes. Both hours and minutes have two digits, like 09:00. Make a regex to find time in the string: Lunch at 10:10 in the room 123:456. In this task thereâ€™s no need to check time correctness yet, so 25:99 can also be a valid result. The regex should not match 333:333.
